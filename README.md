## Welcome to Binghamton University KnitWits

![Image](KnitWits.jpg =100x)

We are an organization of knitters and crocheters who are committed to promoting our craft on the Binghamton campus and within the greater Binghamton area

Our organization meets weekly on Monday nights from 7:30-9:00 PM in University Union 111. We periodically sell our products on campus and at the end of every academic year we select a few charities to donate all proceeds to.
